					<h5>SmartHome</h5>
					<h3>App to manage smart devices and appliances at home</h3>
					<h5>Roles: UX Design & UX Research</h5>
				</div>
				<h4>Overview</h4>
				<p>As a part of the course project, I decided to create a smart home app. The aim of the app was to help the user to <strong>manage</strong> most, if not all, the <strong>smart devices</strong> available and in use to them at their home.
					Along with that, I wanted to give the user the option to create "scenes" or automations to further enhance their experience of using the smart devices.
				</p>

				<h4>Problem</h4>
				<p>Smart device users need a way to manage and control multiple smart home devices conveniently with their mobile phones.</p>

				<h4>Research</h4>
				<p>I interviewed 2 users for this project. One user owns multiple smart devices and the other owns only one smart device but plans to get more for their home. Questions were largely related to their experience using apps to control 
					the devices they own. From the interviews, I found following issues come up:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Devices in a single page or room are pretty scattered and not organized.</li>
					<li>Inability to control level of access for users other than the owner of the devices.</li>
					<li>Preference for a more minimal design compared to SmartThings.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Based on the interview outcomes and further study of the main competitors in this category, namely Apple Home, Google Nest, and Samsung SmartThings, I decided to focus on the following features:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Device interactions: The usual interactions which involve turning a device on or off, tweaking the device settings (for eg. altering thermostat temperature), and as such.</li>
					<li>Adding devices and users.</li>
					<li>Creating automations involving multiple devices.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>What Next?</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Need to expa nd more on each device's interaction through their respective settings page.</li>
					<li>Need to make the app more accessible.</li>
					<li>Perform proper user testing.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Learnings</h4>
				<p>This project presented me with the opportunity to work on an idea from start to finish and create a complete app. My prior experience in design was strictly focused on one or two screens or one particular feature of an existing app. But thanks to this project, I got a good grip on how to bring an idea for a complete app into reality.</p>

					<h5>OLX Redesign</h5>
					<h3>Buy, sell or exchange goods</h3>
					<h5>Roles: UX Design</h5>
				</div>
				<h4>Overview</h4>
				<p>OLX is a C2C platform for buying, selling or exchanging goods, like electronics, vehicles, appliances, furniture, daily items and so on. 
					While it has gone through couple of iterations over the years, there are still some problems which can hinder the experience of using the website for the user. With this redesign, I am trying to address them.</p>

				<h4>Research</h4>
				<p>I started with understanding the user flow of the website which currently exists. I found out that there are two main flows: Selling products and Buying products.</p>
				<img class="proj-img" src="images/img-olx-currentflow.png" alt="OLX Current Flow">
				<p>After I understood the flows, I performed a heuristic evaluation, using Ben Shneiderman's 8 Golden Rules, and I found out the following problems:</p>
				<img class="proj-img" src="images/img-olx-problems.png" alt="OLX Problems">

				<h4>Design System</h4>
				<p>Based on my sketches, I started working on components for the website. I wanted to keep quite a few elements which are part of the existing design and tweak few others to give a sleeker feel to the website.</p>

				<h4>Feedback</h4>
				<p>I got my final designs peer-reviewed and following were the quotes I received in response:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><i>"Cleaner design with lot more breathing space"</i></li>
					<li><i>"Very compact and to the point"</i></li>
					<li><i>"Can try to work on a prototype to see how the interactions work"</i></li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Learnings</h4>
				<p>This project helped me improve my skills in <strong>heuristic evaluation</strong> & <strong>working on design systems</strong>. It helped me improve my critique skills and gave me a new perspective towards developing design systems.</p>

					<h5>Pay1</h5>
					<h3>Creating a Design System</h3>
					<h5>Role: UX Design</h5>
				</div>
				<h4>Overview</h4>
				<p><a class="link" href="https://www.pay1.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Pay1 - Website">Pay1</a> focuses on providing digital payment platform for the businesses in the unorganized retail sector of India, and help them expand and scale better while achieving financial empowerment.</p>
				<h4>My responsibilities</h4>
				<p>As a UX Design intern, I worked with the design team and development team. We <strong>created the Pay1 Design System</strong>, inspired from Material Design. I also <strong>led the design of the user reward system</strong> in the Distributor app of Pay1, but I cannot delve into the details of the module due to NDA. Please contact me if you want further details regarding it.</p>
				<p>I conducted <strong>user research, competitor analysis and user interviews</strong>, and tasked with <strong>creating information architecture, wireframes, visual design and prototypes</strong> for the user reward system, and focused on the <strong>design of the components</strong> in the Design System.</p>
				<img class="proj-img" src="images/img-pay101.png" alt="Design System p1">
				
				<h4>Building a design system</h4>
				<p>As Pay1 had multiple apps, each for different audience and with different features, there was a <strong>need for a design system and component library</strong> that represents the values of the company and provides a unified ecosystem for the apps. So this was one of the tasks which I started with when I joined the company. The work was already started by the existing design team a little before I joined and I was tasked with creating the <strong>components</strong> and contribute to the <strong>color palette</strong>, which you can see below.</p>
				<img class="proj-img" src="images/img-pay1-palette.png" alt="color palette">
				<p>When I started working on the design system, user research had been conducted, where we got the answers to questions related to the customer experience, usability, intuitive nature of the apps, and cohesive nature of the apps. That gave us a solid platform to work on. We drew inspiration from Material Design principles and got to work.</p>
				<img class="proj-img" src="images/img-pay102.png" alt="Design System p2">
				
				<h4>Components</h4>
				<p>The design team conducted a <strong>meeting with the developers, product managers and stakeholders</strong> to understand the parts of the apps we had and prioritize which parts needed to be a common component and get their ideas on the design system. The decisions were made based on user data collected from the app and user interviews conducted.</p>
				<p>After we decided on the components, I started <strong>designing the Dialog boxes, Overlays, Cards, Lists and Buttons</strong> used in the apps. Idea was to keep the <strong>UI simple and make it accessible</strong> as the target audience is a largely uneducated or less exposed to the smartphone culture. This drove the developement of the design system as a whole, while striving for a more organized foundation based on which designs can be made for Pay1.</p>
				
				<img class="proj-img" src="images/img-pay103.png" alt="Design System p3">

				<h4>Learnings</h4>
				<p>Despite the short time spent with the team, I gained experience with the process of <strong>creating a unified design system, performing user research, user journey mapping, and usability testing</strong>. This internship gave me the chance to work as a pure designer and the opportunity to be a part of the <strong>product thinking</strong> process. The experience working as a developer helped me get my points and design decisions across the developer team.</p>

					<h5>GroupFit</h5>
					<h3>Promote a collaborative way of keeping yourself fit and healthy</h3>
				</div>
				<h4>Overview</h4>
				<p>GroupFit is an app solution for an 8 hour long hackathon.</p>
				
				<h4>Problem</h4>
				<p>Maintaining fitness with a busy work schedule is tough. It is a struggle to get into a routine. A solution is needed to help keep the user motivated to keep a daily routine and provide some support with their efforts.</p>

				<h4>Solution</h4>
				<p>An easy-to-use app which provides the user to form groups with friends and people with similar interests and participate in group activities based on each person's schedule, thereby <strong>promoting collaboration among the users</strong> with respect to fitness.</p>
				<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; width: 100%;"><iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="100%" height="500" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FghBzhKgntMDm8oEbFGYj3i%2FDesign%3Fpage-id%3D0%253A1%26node-id%3D6%253A48%26viewport%3D241%252C48%252C0.23%26scaling%3Dscale-down%26starting-point-node-id%3D6%253A48" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

				<h4>Research</h4>
				<p>From the user research I conducted for this problem, I was presented with following findings:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Scheduling time for exercise is tough.</li>
					<li>Having others performing the same activity as the you gives motivation to do the activity themselves.</li>
					<li>Knowledge of activites happening around you helps in engaging with new people.</li>
					<li>Less complicated app will be helpful.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Information Architecture</h4>
				<img class="proj-img" src="images/img-gf01.png" alt="GroupFit - Information Architecture">
				
				<p>Upon analysis with apps like MyFitnessPal and the user interviews, I found that the <strong>community aspect</strong> has been overlooked more often than not. They rely on the user to be accountable for themselves. While the approach isn't wrong, but the <strong>advantages of working out as a group cannot be underestimated</strong>. It helps in lowering stress, making exercise more engaging and fun, and thus helping people to be more motivated to continue the routine. This is why I chose to focus on this aspect in this app.</p>
				
				<h4>Mid-fidelity Wireframes</h4>
				<img class="proj-img" src="images/img-gf02.png" alt="GroupFit - 1">
				<img class="proj-img" src="images/img-gf03.png" alt="GroupFit - 2">

				<p>One of the key components of this app is the scheduling of activities and integrating it with Google Calendar. Another notable point is that the app only suggests activites and people based on the availability in their schedules and activity preferences.</p>

				<h4>Learnings</h4>
				<p>This project helped me improve my skills in <strong>prototyping and design thinking</strong>. Due to the very short time, it was a challenge to be able to implement most of my ideas, conduct a more thorough user research and conduct user testing. On the other hand, I was able to <strong>experiment with my visual design</strong> and try interactions which isn't common practice in most apps. While there is scope for improvement in the app, in terms of accessibility, design, and features, I wanted to showcase <strong>what I was able to do in short space of time with limited resources</strong>.</p>

					<h3>Developing a B2C platform and internal dashboards</h3>
					<h5>Roles: UX Design & Web Development</h5>
				</div>
				<h4>About the company</h4>
				<p>Arzooo is a platform which aims to provide a digital inventory to the retailers on ground, along with sourcing and services to compete with online stores and drive up their sales.</p>
				
				<h4>My roles and responsibilities</h4>
				<p>As a <strong>front end developer</strong> at Arzooo, I worked on multiple products, providing support in both <strong>tech and design</strong> aspects of the products. Being a rapidly growing startup, Arzooo gave me the opportunity to work on a wide array of technologies and helped me improve my skills as a developer and as a designer.</p>
				<p>On most projects, I was tasked with performing the <strong>user research</strong> for products and handle the development cycle. I also worked on <strong>visual design, interaction design and user journey mapping</strong> primarily.</p>
				<p>My work here at Arzooo is under NDA. So if you want to discuss more about the projects and my role in them, do contact me.</p>

				<h4>More about my work</h4>
				<p>I worked on their B2C platform called GoStor as a developer initially and then took over the UI/UX design of the website. I worked with Adobe XD and Photoshop to <strong>create wireframes and visuals for the website</strong>, and worked with React.js to develop the website. Recently, the website is undergoing a massive shift, triggered by key decisions taken by the stakeholders and I presented a <strong>revised design system</strong> for the new platform, which now will be used for the platform as it goes under the revamp at the moment.</p>
				<p>I also <strong>developed the home website of <a class="link" href="http://arzooo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Arzooo">Arzooo</a></strong> along with the lead front end developer. My role was to <strong>create the webpage and the components</strong> involved while the lead developer worked on the interactions. Along with this, I also was responsible for </strong>developing internal dashbaords</strong> which were used by the business, finance and analytics teams, to maintain smooth functioning of the daily processes, helping improve the efficiency by 20%.</p>
				<p>Another contribution came in the form of <a class="link" href="http://the-electronics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="The Electronics">The Electronics</a> for which I acted as the main front-end developer, while chipping in with occasional design decisions.</p>
				
				<h4>Learnings</h4>
				<p>Thanks to the different projects I was part of, I got the opportunity to <strong>understand how business decisions are taken</strong> with respect to the product and how inputs from stakeholders should be incorporated in the designs. It also helped me understand how I can <strong>communicate design decisions to the development team</strong> and also understand both the sides during product development cycle.</p>

				<h4>About the company</h4>
				<p>Deloitte is one of the most well-known companies in the world and also a part of the Big 4 in the the consulting industry. I was lucky to start my career at this company.</p> 
				
				<h4>My roles and responsibilities</h4>
				<p>While my role by name was that of a technology analyst, thanks to the diverse team I was a part of, I was able to work in interesting projects and in different capacities.</p>
				<p>I got to do <strong>user research</strong> in a controlled environment, <strong>plan the requirements and outcome</strong> based on inputs from stakeholders, and develop desktop applications. I was the <strong>UX designer and lead developer</strong> for a project involving creation of an internal assessment tool.</p>
				<p>My work at Deloitte US is under NDA, hence I cannot show you my work in any capacity. If you want to discuss my work, do contact me.</p>
				
				<h4>More about my work</h4>
				<p>I primarily <strong>developed smart factory solutions</strong> for clients in the manufacturing sector using React.js and Vue.js mainly. These projects involved <strong>meetings with stakeholders</strong>, tech architects, managers and developers and gave me an insight into how product development cycle works from start to finish and helped me understand how to work with client demands and balance it with feasibility and good UX. All my projects followed <strong>Agile methodology.</strong></p>
				<p>I also had the opportunity to work on an internal assessment tool as a <strong>UX designer and lead developer</strong>, where I followed <strong>Material Design</strong> and used <strong>Invision and Zeplin</strong> and developed the tool using React.js. I <strong>worked with the stakeholders</strong> and senior managers involved in the project. This was my first real project where I was able to <strong>oversee the product development from start to finish</strong>, and helped me find my interest in product design.</p>
				
				<h4>Learnings</h4>
				<p>As this was my first job after graduating, I got exposed to a lot of processes which are used for developing a product and methodologies like <strong>Agile, CI/CD and LeanUX</strong>. I gained a perspective regarding how development works and how <strong>interaction between design teams and development teams</strong> happen. I gained some valuable experience in creating and using components and design systems, and also <strong>developing desktop based clients and applications</strong>.</p>
